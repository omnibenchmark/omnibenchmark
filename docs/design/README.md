# Omnibenchmark Design Documents

This directory contains design documents for the Omnibenchmark project. Design documents (or "design docs") are technical specifications that describe major features, architectural decisions, and system changes.

## Purpose

Design docs serve several important purposes:
- Document architectural decisions and their rationales
- Provide a framework for technical discussion before implementation
- Serve as reference material for contributors and maintainers
- Create a historical record of the project's evolution

## Document Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial proposal, open for discussion
2. **Review**: Under active review by team members
3. **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Changes have been implemented
5. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer design doc

## Creating a New Design Document

1. Copy `000-template.md` to a new file named with the next available number and a descriptive title (e.g., `002-feature-name.md`)
2. Fill in all the metadata fields
3. Write your proposal following the template structure
4. Submit for review via pull request

## Document Structure

Each design document should follow a consistent structure:
- **Preamble**: Document metadata (authors, status, date, etc.)
- **Problem Statement**: What issue or need is being addressed
- **Design Goals**: What the solution aims to achieve
- **Solution Details**: The proposed implementation approach
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches and why they weren't chosen
- **Implementation Plan**: How and when the solution will be implemented
- **References**: Related documents, issues, and external resources

## Existing Design Documents

- [001-module-metadata.md](./001-module-metadata.md): Module metadata specification
