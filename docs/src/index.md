**Omnibenchmark**  provides community-driven, extensible and continuously-updating benchmarks. Omnibenchmark defines, runs and versions benchmark execution pipelines by leveraging a formal benchmark specification and a set of (reusable) benchmarking modules. Each benchmarking module implements a data processing step (typically a preprocessing step, method, or metric) and is stored as an independent git repository. Anyone can start (or contribute to) a benchmark. A contribution can be a relevant ground truth dataset, a missing method or metric, or update to existing modules. Omnibenchmark relies on widely used, free and open software solutions, including: git (version control system), Snakemake (workflow management system), Easybuild (reproducible software environments), and apptainer (containerization), among others.
