# Benchmark Definition Reference

The whole benchmark is defined in a YAML file. The following template shows all available options, their types, and whether they are required.

This template is automatically generated from the application's source code and is always up-to-date.

```yaml title="benchmark_template.yaml"
--8<-- "templates/benchmark_template.yaml"
```
