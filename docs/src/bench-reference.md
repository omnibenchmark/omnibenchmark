# Benchmark Definition Reference

The whole benchmark is defined in a YAML file. The following template shows all available options, their types, and whether they are required.

Do note that, if relative paths are used wherever a path is expected, they are relative to the location of the benchmark file itself.

This template is automatically generated from the application's source code and is always up-to-date.

```yaml title="benchmark_template.yaml"
--8<-- "templates/benchmark_template.yaml"
```
