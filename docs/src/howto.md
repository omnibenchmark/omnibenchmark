## Add parameters to a benchmark YAML

Module `P1` is parametrized and will run twice, once with `-a 0 -b 0.1` and second with `-a 1 -b 0.1`.


```yaml
[snip]
stages:
    [snip]
  - id: process
    modules:
      - id: P1
        software_environment: "R"
        parameters:
          - values: ["-a 0", "-b 0.1"]
          - values: ["-a 1", "-b 0.1"]
        repository:
          url: https://github.com/omnibenchmark-example/process.git
          commit: ac5365e
[snip]

```

## Exclude certain module-module chains

Module `M1` won't use inputs from module `D2`.

```yaml
[snip]
stages:
- id: methods
    modules:
      - id: M1
        software_environment: "python"
        exclude:
          - D2
        repository:
          url: https://github.com/omnibenchmark-example/method.git
          commit: 1004cdd
   [snip]
```

## Use a custom singularity container to run methods

We recommend building singularity containers using easybuild and `ob software singularity build --easyconfig [easyconfig]`. Still, it is possible to use any singularity container from an ORAS-compatible registry (could be a GitLab registry), or available locally as a SIF file.

```yaml
---
id: bench1

[snip]

software_environments:
  remote_custom_container:
    description: "A singularity container from a registry"
    ## update the path to an ORAS-compatible registry
    apptainer: oras://registry.renkulab.io/izaskun.mallona/sing
  local_custom_container:
    description: "A singularity container - locally available as a SIF"
    ## local path to a local SIF file
    apptainer: /home/user/singularity_image.sif
```

## Choosing the right software backend (lmod, singularity, conda)

Omnibenchmark itself is a python package. Some of its dependencies, namely those related to (reproducible) software stack management, are OS-specific.

Software can be managed:

- Using the host's binaries. If relevant interpreters/software are in your $PATH (perhaps using a virtual environment, or directly), they're accessible to omnibenchmark.
- Using conda. For that `conda` is required. We provide a conda environment YAML to help installing all dependencies.
- Using apptainer. For that, apptainer is needed.
- Using environment modules (lmod). For that, lmod is needed.

Similarly, on MacOS:

- Using the host's binaries. If relevant interpreters/software are in your $PATH (perhaps using a virtual environment, or directly), they're accessible to omnibenchmark.
- Using conda. For that [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is required. We provide an `environment.yaml` to help building the environment.
- Using singularity. It won't work unless using a virtual machine to provide a Linux-friendly host to singularity.
- Using environment modules (lmod). For that, lmod needs to be installed.

We haven't fully tested omnibenchmark on Windows, but we would recommend using the  Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Configuration file

Omnibenchmark uses a configuration file to store settings such as paths and environment variables. The configuration file is stored at:

- Linux: `~/.config/omnibenchmark/omnibenchmark.cfg`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/omnibenchmark/omnibenchmark.cfg`

### Format

The configuration file uses the INI format with sections and key-value pairs:

```ini
[section1]
key1 = value1
key2 = value2

[section2]
key3 = value3
```

### Common Settings

You might want to configure:

- **Easybuild paths**: Set `MODULEPATH` and `ROBOTPATH` in the `easybuild` section
  to specify where modules are installed and where to find easyconfigs.

- **Dataset storage**: Set `datasets` in the `dirs` section to control where
  benchmark datasets are stored.

For more detailed information about the configuration system, including programmatic access,
see the [Configuration System](config.md) documentation.
